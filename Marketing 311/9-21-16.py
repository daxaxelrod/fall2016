Please note that I wasn't' paying attention in class today as I was drafting a declination email to rosenberg


Good Morning Jordan,

Unfortunatly I cannot accept your offer in it's' current state. When we first started talking,
I was under the assumption that you were looking for a technical co-founder but based on your levels of compensation,
it seems that you are looking for a contracted employee.

Now you have never built an app before so you can't' empathize with the amount of work something like this is. Developing an app and a backend is
serious work that you dont seem to be taking into account. It should have been a serious warning sign to me when you breifly brought up that you turned down a co founder after he offered 50%.
Unless you find another cofounder that is willing to work for years while you retain 80% at a minimum is beyond wishful thinking.

It never even occured to me that you thought that 'coming on as a full time employee' was even part of the discussion. When I take on a project, I'm' full time already. As a cofounder, you are full time.

Your time schedule is worrysome. You took 10 days to response to my last email. 10 Days. You also took a decent amount of time to talk to advisors, which to me shows indesisiveness.

#FINAL
Good Morning Jordan,

Unfortunatly I cannot accept your offer in it's' current state and here's' why.
    1. 50% is nominal for the ammount of work involved. If it was just your idea, I'd' ask for 95% but since you are adding value in terms of your network.
    2. I have to take into account the tangible value of my time. Since the ~10 days since your last email, I've' been offered freelance work for another startup app in the campus social networking space for $800.
        The work would take me roughly 3 days to complete. Roughly 12% for a year of work for an unproven idea with no capital is beyond what any resonable developer will take. Not to mention equity dillution in the event of a raise!
    3. Time is critical in any startup, especially one where the cofounders are remote. I know you have your reasons but there has been a certain latency in your responses which makes it that much more difficult to wrap my head around
        the concept that you burn the midnight oil, especially since the offer was identical to the one you put forth on the 8th

    I wish you the best blah blah good luck

    this is just to shawn first
    best,
    david
