Goes over perpetuity

Suppose felli co wants to sell preferred stock at 100 bucks a share
a similar preferred stock  offers a dividend of $1 per quarter

what dividend will fellini have to offer?


        Start with preferred stock on the market
$40 = $1/interest_rate
interest_rate = $1/$40 = 2.5%
        Go back to fellini
$100 = dividend/ interest_rate
interest_rate = 2.5%
dividend = $2.50

fellini will have to offer $2.50


Annuity

t=0   1    2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 ............. ininity
                    Pv perpetuity = a

                                    _______________________________
t=0                                     9   10 ............. ininity
                                    Pv perpetuity b


He's' basically saying that if you subtract the two
you get the value of the Annuity from year 0 to 8
like insurance compnayes are not going to give an annuity into infinity
they're' going to stop after x years and this is how to value that

Math
[a - b/ (1+interest_rate)^8] = PV annuity
                    or
c = payment
[(c/interest_rate) - c/interest_rate(1+interest_rate)^8] = Pv annuity

both fomulas bring you to the same conclusion

slide 9 has examples

Another way to write the fomula

PV of annuity = payment * ( ((1 + interest_rate)^t - 1) / interest_rate )

all the problems in the slides are based of these formulas

if the payment is made at the beginning of the annuity its called and annuity due
