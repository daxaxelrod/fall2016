Cash flow to creditors = interest paid - net new borrowing
    interest paid is on income statement
    net new borrowing
        long term debt account
        the delta between the two

cash flow to stockholders = dividends paid - net new equity raised
    dividends on income statement
    net new equity is on balance sheet

if you add both together you get........
    you get cash flow from assets using operating cash flows and all the rest
    it is the cash flow identity
